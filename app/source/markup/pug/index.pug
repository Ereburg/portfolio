                //- p(class="regular-text").
                //-     I am an internet enthusiast with a penchant for embracing the noob life. I love tinkering with code, and find nothing more satisfying than bringing designs to life. Offline, I like science, films, art, music, and buying books without reading them. Favourite film is Lord of the Rings. My cat Purry is obviously the most important part of my life. This might have been written by Purry.

                    Living with passion is what I strictly adhere to. ‚ÄúAlways do what you love‚Äù how much ever hackneyed this sounds it holds absolutely true. That's why I'm developer. Not for the sole reason of ‚Äúloving‚Äù to programming but it helps me to get rid of the world and escape into a different dimension of my own.
                p(class="regular-text").
                    I am a continuous learner. Learning for me equates to exploring new ideas and growing as an individual. I just cannot imagine my life devoid of development. I freely express my creativity and imagination by developing. And to give my passion of developing a platform I have a GitHub account named, Ereburg.
